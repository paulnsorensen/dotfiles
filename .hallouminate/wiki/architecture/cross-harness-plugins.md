# Cross-harness plugin support

A **plugin** in `ap` is a meta-item: at ingest time `ap` decomposes it into
its supported bundled primitives (MCP server(s), skills, agents, and hooks) and
feeds each into the **existing** per-harness renderers. No new renderer is
introduced; a decomposed plugin item is indistinguishable from a
registry-native item downstream. `commands/` are intentionally unsupported on
the decomposed path; native plugin installs may still expose native commands.

This is distinct from the `global@local` profile-as-plugin track (where a
profile dir IS a Claude plugin dir). Cross-harness plugins add a 5th registry
(`agents/plugins/registry.yaml`) that any harness can consume.

---

## Path model: marketplace root vs payload root

**Critical distinction** — the `path:` or git-cloned cache in `registry.yaml` resolves to the **marketplace
root**, not the plugin payload root.

```
marketplace root:  ~/Dev/milknado/
  .claude-plugin/
    marketplace.json          ← {name: "milknado", plugins: [{source: "./plugins/milknado"}]}

payload root:      ~/Dev/milknado/plugins/milknado/
  .mcp.json                   ← {command: uvx, args: [milknado-mcp]}
  skills/
    harvest/SKILL.md
    load-roadmap/SKILL.md
    milknado-config/
      SKILL.md
      references/flavor-presets.md  ← NOT a skill
```

**What each path is used for:**

- `marketplace root` → registry `path:` field; `extraKnownMarketplaces` path;
  `claude plugin marketplace add` argument
- `payload root` → resolved from `marketplace.json plugins[].source` relative
  to marketplace root; `_source_dir` on all emitted items; `.mcp.json`,
  `skills/`, `agents/`, and `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` hooks are read here

**Why this matters:** `claude plugin marketplace add` and `extraKnownMarketplaces`
both require the directory containing `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`. Pointing
them at the payload root fails silently with "Marketplace file not found".

---

## The decomposer seam: `ingest._expand_plugins`

`expand_registries()` in `agent-profile/agent_profile/ingest.py` wires in
`_expand_plugins()` after the other four readers. Per plugin entry, the
decomposer:

1. Resolves the **marketplace root** (`path:` in the registry; supports
   `~/`, absolute, or repo-relative) — the dir holding
   `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`.
2. Reads `marketplace.json`, picks the `plugins[]` entry whose `name` matches
   the registry key, and resolves its `source` to the **payload root** —
   relative to the marketplace root, or to
   `marketplace-root/<metadata.pluginRoot>` when that optional field is set
   (milknado inlines the full path in `source`; hallouminate uses
   `pluginRoot: "./plugins"` + `source: "./hallouminate"`). Both `source` and
   `pluginRoot` are rejected if absolute or containing `..`.
3. Reads `<payload>/.mcp.json` → MCP item(s), carrying the entry's `harnesses`
   and `gate_unless`.
4. Walks `<payload>/skills/<n>/SKILL.md` → `path:` skill items (one per named
   skill dir, skipping any subdir that lacks `SKILL.md` — e.g. `references/`).
5. Walks `<payload>/agents/*.md` → agent items, parsing leading YAML
   frontmatter for metadata while preserving the original body file.
6. Reads `<payload>/.claude-plugin/plugin.json` hooks → registry-style hook
   items; script hooks can reach Claude/Codex/Cursor/Copilot, literal command
   hooks are Claude-only on the decomposed path.
7. Ignores `commands/`; there is no decomposed command primitive.
8. Stamps every emitted item's `_source_dir` **at the payload root**.

### C-var: env var validation for plugin MCPs

Mirrors `_expand_mcps`: a non-optional plugin MCP with an unset `${VAR}` raises
`EnvResolutionError`; an optional server with an unset var is silently dropped.
Env values are carried through as literals (not substituted at ingest).

### The canonical marketplace name rule

`marketplace_name` comes from `marketplace.json["name"]`, not the registry YAML
key. When they differ (which they can), the marketplace.json name is authoritative:

- `extraKnownMarketplaces` key = `marketplace_name`
- `enabledPlugins` key = `<name>@<marketplace_name>`
- `clean()` un-merges using `marketplace_name`

### The critical `_source_dir` rule

Every renderer resolves payload files via:

```python
Path(item["_source_dir"]) / item["path"]
```

`_source_dir` MUST be the plugin payload root, not the dotfiles repo root.
Mis-stamping silently copies from the wrong tree. This is the single most
common failure mode and is unit-tested explicitly:
`test_ingest_plugins.py::test_source_dir_is_payload_root_not_repo_root` proves
it fails under repo-root stamping.

---

## Registry schema (`agents/plugins/registry.yaml`)

Each entry requires exactly one source field — `git:` or `path:` (both or neither is a `ParseError`):

```yaml
plugins:
  <name>:
    # Source: exactly one required
    git: https://github.com/org/repo   # clone URL; cached in ~/.cache/ap/plugins/<name>
    branch: main                        # optional; default: main. Only with git:
    subdir: nested/subdir               # optional; only if marketplace root is nested in repo
    # -or-
    path: ~/Dev/myplugin               # local checkout marketplace root

    harnesses: [claude, codex, opencode, cursor, copilot, crush]
    claude_native: true   # Claude gets native marketplace install
    codex_native: true    # Codex gets native marketplace install (codex CLI)
    gate_unless: MY_ENV_VAR   # optional gate
    description: Human-readable description
```

**`git:` vs `path:` mutual exclusivity** — exactly one is required per entry. `git:` is the
portable form: the repo is shallow-cloned into `~/.cache/ap/plugins/<KEY>` on first use and
refreshed on subsequent runs. If the network fetch fails but a populated cache exists,
`ap install base` warns and uses the cache (does not abort). `path:` is the dev-machine
form for local checkouts. The two are mutually exclusive so the resolution is never ambiguous.

**`subdir:`** — optional; only needed when `marketplace.json` lives inside a subdirectory of
the cloned repo rather than the repo root. Relative paths only; `..` is rejected loud.

**`harnesses`** — explicit primitive membership list. For MCPs this remains
especially deliberate: blanket-wide membership taxes every per-request MCP-schema
token budget. For non-MCP plugin primitives, omitted `harnesses` defaults to all
harnesses that support that primitive. See [[architecture/mcp-secret-handling]]
for the token-cost tradeoff and [[architecture/agent-profile]] for how harnesses
membership flows.

**`claude_native` / `codex_native`** — two **independent** native-install flags.
When either is `true`, the decomposer emits a single `native_plugins` record
carrying *both* booleans (`claude_native`, `codex_native`) plus the marketplace
root/name; each renderer consumes only its own flag.

- `claude_native: true` → the claude renderer registers the plugin's
  marketplace and enables it. DEDUP removes `claude` from decomposed MCP,
  skill, agent, and hook harnesses; skills/agents also carry
  `_from_native_plugin=True` so claude renderers skip any native-served item.
- `codex_native: true` → the codex renderer installs the plugin via the codex
  CLI (`codex plugin marketplace add` + `codex plugin add`). DEDUP removes
  `codex` from decomposed MCP, skill, agent, and hook harnesses; skills/agents
  carry a **separate** `_from_codex_native_plugin=True` so the codex renderer
  skips them. The flag is deliberately separate from `_from_native_plugin` —
  reusing claude's flag would make the claude renderer wrongly skip a
  codex-only-native plugin's skills or agents.

When both are `false` (or omitted), every harness receives decomposed primitives.
That is the right choice when a plugin's marketplace.json is absent or the plugin
is not ready for native install (e.g. hallouminate, where the well-known
`mcp__hallouminate__*` namespace must be preserved — a native install would
rescope it to `mcp__plugin_hallouminate_hallouminate__*`).

**`gate_unless`** — propagates to the decomposed MCP's `gate_unless` field,
using the same semantics as the MCP registry gate (see [[agents-dir]]). It
gates only the decomposed MCP items, not the native install paths.

---

## Per-harness reach

| Harness | Receives | Loses |
|---|---|---|
| claude | native marketplace install when `claude_native`; else MCP + skills + agents + hooks | custom `/commands` on decomposed path |
| codex | native marketplace install when `codex_native`; else MCP + skills + agents + hooks | custom `/commands` on decomposed path |
| opencode | MCP + skills + agents | hooks, commands, atomic install |
| cursor | MCP + skills + agents + hooks | custom `/commands` on decomposed path |
| copilot | skills + hooks + agents; MCP only if `harnesses` includes copilot | custom `/commands` |
| crush | MCP only | all non-MCP primitives |

---

## The hybrid decision: native where available, decompose the rest

Claude Code has a native plugin system (marketplace install, plugin-scoped
`mcp__plugin_<name>_<server>__*` tool names, plugin-owned commands/hooks). The
other harnesses have no equivalent atomic install — they only accept
primitives via their config renderers.

The chosen model: each harness with a native plugin system gets the native
install when its flag is set (`claude_native` → claude, `codex_native` → codex);
every other harness gets decomposed primitives via the existing renderers. No
renderer changes are needed for the decomposed path. The two native paths are
independent — a plugin can be claude-native, codex-native, both, or neither.

For entries where a harness's native flag is `false`/omitted, that harness
receives decomposed primitives, same as the non-native harnesses. Copilot,
opencode, cursor, and crush have no usable native-install CLI, so they always
decompose.

---

## DEDUP: preventing double-registration for native installs

When a harness gets the plugin via its native install, adding the same MCP
server to that harness's decomposed config too would cause tool-name collision
and double token cost. DEDUP removes the natively-served harness from the
decomposed MCP's `harnesses` list:

- `claude_native` removes `claude` (native tools are `mcp__plugin_<name>_<server>__*`).
- `codex_native` removes `codex` (codex's MCP filter `mcps_for(..., "codex")`
  then naturally excludes the server from `config.toml`).
- Both flags strip both harnesses; if the result is empty, an empty `harnesses`
  list is emitted so the renderers' membership filter skips the item.

Skills and agents carry per-path skip flags so a natively-served harness's
renderer does not also copy them:

- `_from_native_plugin=True` → claude's `_write_skills` / `_write_agents` skip
  the item. Hook DEDUP removes `claude` from hook `harnesses` instead.
- `_from_codex_native_plugin=True` → codex's `_write_skills` / `_write_agents`
  skip the item. Hook DEDUP removes `codex` from hook `harnesses` instead.

The two flags are **independent on purpose**. A codex-only-native plugin stamps
only `_from_codex_native_plugin`, so claude (decomposed) still gets its skills
and agents; reusing `_from_native_plugin` would wrongly hide them from claude.

---

## Native renderer passes

**Claude** — `_render_native_plugins()` in `claude.py` consumes descriptors with
`claude_native: True`:

1. Reads `entry["marketplace_root"]` and `entry["marketplace_name"]`.
2. Writes `extraKnownMarketplaces[marketplace_name] = {source: {source: "directory", path: <marketplace_root>}}`.
3. Writes `enabledPlugins[f"{name}@{marketplace_name}"] = True`.
4. Calls `claude plugin marketplace add <marketplace_root>` to prime the CLI's
   resolution cache (writing settings.json alone is not sufficient).

`clean()` un-merges by `marketplace_name` (not registry YAML key).

**Codex** — `_render_native_plugins()` in `codex.py` consumes descriptors with
`codex_native: True`, hooked into `render()` right after `_write_mcps`:

1. `codex plugin marketplace add <marketplace_root>` — the codex CLI accepts a
   local path (the git cache dir or local checkout) as a marketplace source.
2. `codex plugin add <name>@<marketplace_name>` — installs from that marketplace.

Both calls go through `_codex_cli()`, which runs `subprocess.run(check=False)`:
idempotent on re-sync (a repeated add/remove does not hard-fail), a missing
`codex` binary is a silent no-op (nothing was decomposed, so nothing is left
inconsistent), and a nonzero exit warns loud rather than swallowing. `clean()`
un-registers via `codex plugin remove <name>@<marketplace_name>` +
`codex plugin marketplace remove <marketplace_name>`.

Unlike claude, codex stores no native-plugin state in a renderer-owned settings
file — the codex CLI owns `~/.codex/config.toml`'s plugin tables. Codex clone-
cache pruning is not handled in `clean()` (tracked as a possible follow-up).

---

## Relationship to `sync.sh` (narrowed, not retired)

`claude/plugins/sync.sh` is **narrowed, not removed**. `claude/.sync` still
invokes it (`bash "$SOURCE_DIR/plugins/sync.sh" --force`) on every claude sync to
register the Claude-only official-marketplace plugins (playwright,
claude-md-management, etc.) listed in `claude/plugins/registry.yaml` — plugins
with no cross-harness payload. Do not delete that invocation: nothing else
registers those marketplaces.

What changed: any plugin that should *also* reach non-Claude harnesses now lives
in the cross-harness registry (`agents/plugins/registry.yaml`), where `ap` ingest
registers its marketplace + `enabledPlugins` via the `native_plugins` list
(`_render_native_plugins`). milknado moved out of `claude/plugins/registry.yaml`
into the cross-harness registry for exactly this reason. The two registries are
**disjoint** — no plugin appears in both, so nothing is registered twice. The
`plugin-sync` alias points to `dots profile install base`; `plugin-edit` points
to `agents/plugins/registry.yaml`.

---

## Membership and the per-request MCP token tax

Every MCP in a harness's config is loaded at startup and its schema is
fetched per request. Blanket-wide membership (all harnesses for every plugin)
would tax every request with the plugin's tool schemas even when the user
is not using the plugin. Explicit `harnesses:` lists in the registry keep
this deliberate. See [[architecture/mcp-secret-handling]] for how schema
loading interacts with secret passthrough.

---

## Gotchas

- **Source must resolve to marketplace root, not payload** — the `path:` value
  (or the git-cloned cache dir + `subdir:` if set) must point at the directory
  containing `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`. Pointing at the payload
  subdirectory (which has `.mcp.json` but no `marketplace.json`) raises
  `ParseError` at ingest.
- **`_source_dir` mis-stamping** — must be the payload root (where `.mcp.json`
  and `skills/` live). The unit test explicitly proves the failure mode. If you
  see a renderer failing to find a skill file, check `_source_dir` on the item first.
- **Canonical marketplace name from marketplace.json** — the `name` field in
  `marketplace.json` is authoritative for `extraKnownMarketplaces` key and
  `<plugin>@<marketplace_name>` enabledPlugins entry. The registry YAML key
  can differ.
- **Dev-path `.mcp.json`** — plugin payloads under development often use
  `--from /path/to/dev/repo` in their `.mcp.json`. This must be replaced
  with the portable `uvx <package>` form before the plugin can be used on
  other machines. The milknado migration (`fix/mcp-portable-uvx`) is the
  reference example.
- **Primitive-name collisions** — `expand_registries` raises `ParseError` if a
  plugin skill, agent, hook, or MCP name collides with an existing registry item
  or another plugin's item. Silent overwrite of shared trees/config is Rule 9.
- **Commands are not decomposed** — a payload `commands/` directory is ignored.
  Native installs may expose commands inside Claude/Codex, but the decomposed
  path emits no command items and there is no commands registry.
- **`clean`/uninstall ref-counting** — decomposed items land in shared/merged
  files (opencode.json, .cursor/mcp.json) and shared skill trees. `clean()`
  must attribute items to the plugin so uninstalling one plugin doesn't strip
  another's contributions. The renderers handle this via their existing
  surgical-removal logic.
- **marketplace-add CLI prime** — for `claude_native` entries, writing
  `extraKnownMarketplaces` alone is not enough. The `claude plugin marketplace
  add <marketplace_root>` CLI call primes the resolution cache (handled by
  `_render_native_plugins`). Without it, a freshly-added local plugin fails
  to install on first sync.
- **codex native install is CLI-only** — `codex_native` entries write no
  renderer-owned config; install is entirely via `codex plugin marketplace add`
  - `codex plugin add` (the codex CLI owns `~/.codex/config.toml`'s plugin
  tables). On a machine without the `codex` binary the pass is a silent no-op,
  so a render never hard-fails merely because codex is absent.
- **marketplace-add IS fatal on failure (codex)** — unlike `plugin add` (which
  warns on nonzero, tolerating "already installed" on re-sync), the codex
  `marketplace add` step (`_codex_cli_strict`) raises `RuntimeError` on a
  nonzero exit. Rationale: DEDUP has already stripped `codex` from the decomposed
  MCP, so a failed marketplace add would leave the plugin in NEITHER the native
  install NOR the decomposed render — it silently vanishes from codex. Failing
  loud turns that silent strip into a visible render failure. Idempotency is
  preserved by probing `codex plugin marketplace list` first and skipping the
  add when the marketplace is already registered.
- **two independent native flags** — `_from_native_plugin` (claude) and
  `_from_codex_native_plugin` (codex) must not be conflated. A codex-only-native
  plugin must NOT stamp the claude flag, or claude (which decomposes it) would
  lose its skills and agents.

## Worked example: milknado

**Marketplace root** (git-cloned cache): `~/.cache/ap/plugins/milknado/`
(cloned from `https://github.com/paulnsorensen/milknado`, branch `main`)

**Payload root** (from `marketplace.json` `source: ./plugins/milknado`):
`~/.cache/ap/plugins/milknado/plugins/milknado`

**Layout:**

```
~/.cache/ap/plugins/milknado/          ← marketplace root (git clone cache)
  .claude-plugin/marketplace.json      ← {plugins: [{name: milknado, source: ./plugins/milknado}]}
  plugins/milknado/                    ← payload root (the _source_dir stamp)
    .mcp.json                          ← {command: uvx, args: [milknado-mcp]}
    skills/
      harvest/SKILL.md
      load-roadmap/SKILL.md
      milknado-config/
        SKILL.md
        references/flavor-presets.md   ← subfile; NOT a skill itself
```

**Registry entry:**

```yaml
milknado:
  git: https://github.com/paulnsorensen/milknado
  branch: main
  harnesses: [claude, codex, opencode, cursor, copilot, crush]
  claude_native: true
  # codex_native: DISABLED on main. milknado's upstream
  # .agents/plugins/marketplace.json (the manifest codex's `plugin marketplace
  # add` parses) has only interface.displayName, no top-level `name`, so
  # `codex plugin marketplace add` exits 1. With the flag set, DEDUP would strip
  # codex from the decomposed MCP AND the native add would fail -> milknado
  # absent from codex entirely. Re-enable once upstream adds `"name": "milknado"`
  # to that manifest. The renderer machinery is landed + tested regardless.
  description: Mikado execution engine — goal decomposition, batch planning, detached ralph-loop runs
```

**What `_expand_plugins` emits:**

- 1 MCP item: `{name: milknado, command: uvx, args: [milknado-mcp], harnesses: [...], _source_dir: <payload>}`
- 3 skill items: `harvest`, `load-roadmap`, `milknado-config` each with `_source_dir: <payload>`, `path: skills/<name>`, and effective non-native harnesses
- no agent or hook items today because the milknado payload currently has no `agents/*.md` or `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` hooks to decompose
- 1 native_plugins descriptor carrying `claude_native: true` + `codex_native: false`
  (the claude renderer registers the marketplace; the codex renderer ignores the
  descriptor since its flag is off). With only `claude_native`, DEDUP strips
  `claude` from MCP/skill/agent/hook harnesses; `codex` stays, so decomposed
  primitives still reach codex/opencode/cursor/copilot as supported (+ crush for
  MCP if listed). When `codex_native` is re-enabled upstream, DEDUP would
  additionally strip `codex` and the codex renderer would install via the codex
  CLI instead.

**PyPI dependency:** `uvx milknado-mcp` requires milknado to be published to
PyPI. Until then, the rendered config references the portable form but the MCP
will not launch. Publishing is a separate milknado release step.
