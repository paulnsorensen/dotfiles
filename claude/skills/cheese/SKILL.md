description: This skill should be used as the unified entry point when the user drops in any kind of input — a half-formed idea, a spec path, a file path, a PR or issue number, a stack trace, a bug report, or just `/cheese` — and wants the workflow to pick the right next step. Phrases like "/cheese", "what should I do with this", "help me get started", "route this", "figure out what skill I need", or any opening message that does not already name a downstream skill. Classifies the input into an intent shape (clarify, research, rubber-duck, mold, cook, debug-then-cook, age, age-then-cure), announces the detected intent + reason, and gates dispatch behind an explicit `AskUserQuestion` so nothing fires silently. Use even when the user seems to know what they want — confirming the routing decision is the value. Never auto-invokes downstream skills; always pauses for explicit confirmation. Before any other workflow skill.

# /cheese

Use this skill as the single front door to the easy-cheese workflow. Inspect whatever the user dropped in, classify it into an intent shape, announce the routing decision, and gate dispatch on explicit confirmation.

Do not use it once a downstream skill is already running, or when the user has already named the skill they want (`/mold ...`, `/cook ...`, `/age`, etc.) — pass straight through to that skill instead.

## Inputs

Accept anything the user supplies as `$ARGUMENTS`:

- A natural-language feature description, idea, or question.
- A spec path (`.cheese/specs/<slug>.md`) or pasted spec content.
- A bug report, stack trace, failing test output, or reproduction steps.
- A file path, glob, or directory.
- A PR or issue reference (`PR#142`, `#87`, GitHub URL).
- A research question about an external library, API, or pattern.
- An empty or near-empty prompt — treat as "what's next?" and clarify.

If `$ARGUMENTS` is missing entirely and there is no recent context to lean on, ask one clarifying question via `AskUserQuestion` before classifying.

## Flow

1. **Classify** — match `$ARGUMENTS` against the intent shapes in `references/classification.md`. Pick the highest-confidence shape; below the threshold, route to `clarify` (see step 4).
2. **Announce** — print one short paragraph with: detected intent, chosen target skill (or pre-step), and the one-line reason for the decision. Cite the signal that drove it (e.g. "spec path under `.cheese/specs/`", "stack trace present", "PR URL").
3. **Self-check** — run the coherence questions in `references/coherence-check.md` before dispatching. If any fails, downgrade to `clarify` or `research`.
4. **Confirm** — issue an `AskUserQuestion` with the recommended target pre-selected and at least one alternative plus a `Stop` option. The user's selection is the only trigger for dispatch; never invoke a skill silently.
5. **Hand off** — once the user picks, name the next skill and stop. The downstream skill owns its own flow; `/cheese` does not narrate beyond the routing decision.

`/cheese` is a router, not a worker. It never edits files, runs tests, opens PRs, or paraphrases the downstream skill's output.

## Intent shapes

| Intent | Trigger signals | Pre-step | Target skill |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| clarify | Empty input, single keyword, or load-bearing ambiguity | `AskUserQuestion` for the missing fact | re-enter `/cheese` once answered |
| research | Library / API / vendor question, "what's the best…", comparison | — | `/briesearch` |
| rubber-duck | "Help me think through…", architecture discussion, no artifact intent | — | `/culture` |
| mold | Feature description with fuzzy scope, multi-module idea, or stated need for a spec | optional `/briesearch` first if external evidence is missing | `/mold` → `/cook` |
| cook | Spec path, focused fix with clear inputs/outputs/verification, single-file tweak | — | `/cook` |
| debug | Stack trace, failing test, reproduction steps, "why is X broken" | `/culture` (Diagnose) to converge on the cause | `/culture` → `/cook` |
| age | PR reference, file path/glob review request, "is this safe to merge", "find bugs" | — | `/age` |
| age-then-cure | Existing `.cheese/age/<slug>.md` plus a "fix the findings" instruction | — | `/age` (re-scope if needed) → `/cure` |

The full classification table — including disambiguation rules, edge cases, and confidence cues — lives in `references/classification.md`.

## Confidence and the clarify gate

Treat classification confidence qualitatively (`low | medium | high`). Threshold for direct routing is `medium` or better. Below that:

- Pick the **clarify** path and ask exactly one question via `AskUserQuestion`.
- Offer the two most-likely targets as alternatives plus `Stop`.
- Re-enter `/cheese` with the answer; do not chain a partial classification.

Never resolve uncertainty by guessing — silent misrouting is worse than asking once.

## Preferred tools and fallbacks

| Need | Prefer | Fallback |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Reading the input file when it's a path | `cheez-read` | host `Read` |
| Quickly checking whether a slug exists under `.cheese/` | `cheez-search` | `ripgrep`, `find`, file tree |
| PR / issue context | `gh` | the URL or numbers the user provided |
| Confirming routing target with the user | `AskUserQuestion` | a numbered list with explicit "no auto-invoke" wording |

`/cheese` keeps tool use light. Treat anything heavier than a single-file read or one search call as a sign the work belongs in the downstream skill, not in the router.

## Output

Always emit, in order:

1. **Detected intent** — one line, e.g. `Intent: cook (clear single-file fix)`.
2. **Reason** — one line citing the signal (`reason: spec path .cheese/specs/foo.md`).
3. **Target** — the recommended skill, e.g. `Target: /cook .cheese/specs/foo.md`.
4. **Confirmation prompt** — `AskUserQuestion` with the recommended target pre-selected, one alternative, and `Stop`.

If `clarify` is chosen, replace step 4 with the single clarifying question.

## Handoff

Dispatch happens through `AskUserQuestion`. Default option set per intent:

- **clarify** — single targeted question; no skills offered until the answer arrives.
- **research** — `Run /briesearch` (recommended), `Run /culture`, `Stop`.
- **rubber-duck** — `Run /culture` (recommended), `Run /briesearch`, `Stop`.
- **mold** — `Run /mold` (recommended), `Run /briesearch first`, `Stop`.
- **cook** — `Run /cook <slug-or-path>` (recommended), `Run /mold first`, `Stop`.
- **debug** — `Run /culture` (recommended), `Run /mold (Diagnose mode)`, `Stop`.
- **age** — `Run /age <ref>` (recommended), `Run /age --scope <path>`, `Stop`.
- **age-then-cure** — `Run /age <slug>` (recommended), `Run /cure <slug>` (when a fresh report already exists), `Stop`.

Pre-select only the highest-confidence target. If two targets are viable, surface both and let the user decide.

`/cheese` never auto-invokes. The user picks, then the next skill runs.

## Rules

- Classification is the only output until the user confirms.
- One clarifying question, max, before re-entering classification.
- Below `medium` confidence, route to `clarify`, not to a guess.
- Never paraphrase or summarise downstream skill output — that is the downstream skill's job.
- Never edit files, write specs, or run quality gates from `/cheese`.
