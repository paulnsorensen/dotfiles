compatibility: Requires tilth MCP server.
description: This skill should be used when the user asks to read, view, show, open, or display the contents of a file or directory — phrases like "read src/auth.ts", "show me this file", "what's in this directory", "view lines 44-89", "look at the imports". Replaces cat / head / tail / less / more / bat / ls / tree / eza / find / fd / Read / Glob with AST-aware tilth MCP reading and file listing. Use even when the user says "cat", "less", "bat", "tree", "ls", "find", "fd", or "open the file" — never call host Read, Glob, or any shell file viewer / lister directly. If tilth MCP is unavailable, stop and report rather than fall back. Do NOT use for searching symbols or text (use cheez-search), editing code (use cheez-write), or git/gh operations.

# cheez-read

> **Hard dependency**: If `mcp__tilth__tilth_read` is unavailable, stop immediately and report
> "tilth MCP server is not loaded — cannot proceed." Do NOT fall back to `cat`, `Read`, `Glob`,
> or any host tool. Install via `tilth install <host>` (see README "Installing tilth MCP").

## Capability detection

Before the first call, verify tilth is reachable:

1. Check that `mcp__tilth__tilth_read` is in your tool list. If absent, stop and report `"tilth MCP server is not loaded — cannot proceed."`
2. Make a minimal probe call: `tilth_read(path: "README.md", section: "1-1")`. If the response is a JSON-RPC error or transport failure, stop and report `"tilth MCP server present but unhealthy: <error>"`.
3. Any other failure (file not found, bad section range, etc.) is a **content** issue — proceed normally and report the result.

Smart code reading via **tilth MCP** (`tilth_read`, `tilth_files`, `tilth_deps`).
tilth replaces cat/head/tail with AST-aware file reading that understands code structure.

---

## Examples

### "Show me `src/auth.ts`"

```
tilth_read(path: "src/auth.ts")
```

Small files come back with full content and a header (`# src/auth.ts (258
lines, ~3.4k tokens) [full]`); large files get the structural outline
automatically.

### "Read the `handleAuth` function in edit mode so I can change it"

```
tilth_read(path: "src/auth.ts", section: "44-89", edit: true)
```

```text
44:b2c|export function handleAuth(req, res, next) {
45:c3d|  const token = req.headers.authorization?.split(' ')[1];
...
89:e1d|}
```

The `edit: true` flag (or `--edit` in CLI mode) emits hash anchors. Capture
`44:b2c` and `89:e1d` and pass them to cheez-write.

### "List every TypeScript file under `src/handlers/`"

```
tilth_files(glob: "*.ts", scope: "src/handlers/")
```

```text
src/handlers/auth.ts      (~1.8k tokens)
src/handlers/orders.ts    (~3.1k tokens)
src/handlers/webhooks.ts  (~620 tokens)
```

Token estimates let you decide what to read in full vs outline before you
spend any context on it.

---

## Core Principle: Read Smart, Not More

tilth decides what to show based on file size and structure:
- **Small files** → full content with line numbers
- **Large files** → structural outline with line ranges
- **Binary/generated** → skipped with type indicator

This means you never waste tokens on a giant lockfile or minified bundle.

## MCP Tool Reference

### tilth_read — Smart File Reading

```
tilth_read(path: "src/auth.ts")
```

**Output for small files:**
```
# src/auth.ts (258 lines, ~3.4k tokens) [full]

1 │ import express from 'express';
2 │ import jwt from 'jsonwebtoken';
...
```

**Output for large files (automatic outline):**
```
# src/auth.ts (1240 lines, ~16k tokens) [outline]

[1-12]   imports: express(2), jsonwebtoken, @/config
[14-22]  interface AuthConfig
[24-42]  fn validateToken(token: string): Claims | null
[44-89]  export fn handleAuth(req, res, next)
[91-258] export class AuthManager
  [99-130]  fn authenticate(credentials)
  [132-180] fn authorize(user, resource)
```

**Drilling into sections:**
```
# Line range
tilth_read(path: "src/auth.ts", section: "44-89")

# Markdown heading
tilth_read(path: "docs/guide.md", section: "## Installation")
```

**Multiple files in one call:**
```
tilth_read(paths: ["src/auth.ts", "src/routes.ts", "src/middleware.ts"])
```

---

## Hash Anchors — The Edit Bridge

When reading files in **edit mode**, tilth outputs **hash-anchored lines**:

```
42:a3f|  let x = compute();
43:f1b|  return x;
```

The format is `<line>:<hash>|<content>`.

> Plain reads use a `│` (U+2502) column separator. **Edit-mode reads** (the
> ones you need for cheez-write) use `:<hash>|` — note the ASCII pipe and
> the colon. Anchors are only emitted when tilth is run in `--edit` mode.

**Why this matters:**
- These hashes uniquely identify the line content
- They're used by `tilth_edit` (cheez-write) for precise edits
- If the file changes, hashes won't match → edit is rejected safely
- You MUST read before editing to get current hashes

**Memorize anchors for functions you'll edit:**
- Note the start hash of function definitions
- Note the end hash for multi-line replacements
- Pass these to cheez-write later

---

## tilth_files — Directory Listing

Replaces `ls`, `find`, `pwd`, and the Glob tool.

```
tilth_files(glob: "**/*.ts", scope: "src/")
```

**Output:**
```
src/auth.ts  (~3.4k tokens)
src/routes.ts  (~2.1k tokens)
src/middleware.ts  (~1.8k tokens)
```

Token estimates help you decide what to read in full vs outline.

**Common patterns:**
```
# All TypeScript files
tilth_files(glob: "**/*.ts")

# Test files only
tilth_files(glob: "**/*.test.ts")

# Specific directory
tilth_files(glob: "*", scope: "src/handlers/")

# Exclude patterns (negation in the same glob)
tilth_files(glob: "!*_test.go", scope: ".")
```

---

## tilth_deps — Blast Radius Check

```
tilth_deps(path: "src/auth.ts")
```

Use **only** before refactoring (rename, signature change, removal). For
output format and the file-vs-symbol distinction, see the shared reference
in cheez-search:
[`../cheez-search/references/tilth-deps.md`](../cheez-search/references/tilth-deps.md).

---

## Session Memory (Deduplication)

tilth tracks what you've read in the current session:
- Re-reading the same section shows `[shown earlier]` instead of full content
- This saves significant tokens over long sessions
- Forces you to reference memorized anchors instead of re-reading

**Implication:** Read once, memorize anchors, reference later.

---

## Reading Protocol

### For Understanding Code

1. **Start with outline** (let tilth auto-decide):
   ```
   tilth_read(path: "src/auth.ts")
   ```

2. **Drill into relevant sections:**
   ```
   tilth_read(path: "src/auth.ts", section: "44-89")
   ```

3. **Check dependencies if needed:**
   ```
   tilth_deps(path: "src/auth.ts")
   ```

### For Preparing Edits

1. **Read the target section to get hash anchors:**
   ```
   tilth_read(path: "src/auth.ts", section: "44-89")
   ```

2. **Memorize:**
   - Start anchor: `44:a3f`
   - End anchor: `89:b7c`

3. **Pass these to cheez-write** (tilth_edit) for the edit.

### For Exploring a Directory

1. **List files with token estimates:**
   ```
   tilth_files(glob: "*", scope: "src/handlers/")
   ```

2. **Read small files fully, outline large ones:**
   ```
   tilth_read(paths: ["small.ts", "large.ts"])
   ```

## DO NOT

- **DO NOT use cat / head / tail / less / more / bat** to view code — use `tilth_read`. Hash anchors and outline-vs-full token budgeting only work through tilth.
- **DO NOT use ls / tree / eza / find / fd to enumerate code files** — use `tilth_files`. Token estimates and `.gitignore` filtering only work through tilth.
- **DO NOT use the host Read or Glob tools** on code paths — they bypass tilth's session deduplication and emit no anchors.
- **DO NOT re-read files** shown earlier — reference your notes.
- **DO NOT use for searching** — use cheez-search.
- **DO NOT use for editing** — use cheez-write.
- **DO NOT ignore hash anchors** — you'll need them for edits.

---

## Output Token Budget

tilth uses ~6000 tokens as the outline threshold. Files under this show in full;
files over this get structural outlines. Use `section` to get hashlined content
for specific ranges when preparing edits on large files.

---

## What This Skill Doesn't Do

- **Search for symbols or text** — use cheez-search.
- **Edit files** — use cheez-write.
- **Run code or tests** — use appropriate build/test skills.
- **Commit changes** — use git/gh skills.
