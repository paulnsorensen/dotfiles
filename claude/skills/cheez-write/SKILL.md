allowed-tools: mcp__tilth__tilth_edit, mcp__tilth__tilth_read, Bash
compatibility: Requires tilth MCP server. Optional ast-grep (`sg`) for structural codemods (`sg --rewrite`) that span many files.
description: This skill should be used when the user asks to edit, replace, modify, update, change, delete, or insert code in a file — phrases like "replace this function", "delete lines 44-89", "update validateToken", "change the implementation", "add this import", "fix this bug" (when fixing requires editing), or apply a cross-cutting structural change (codemod) like "rewrite every X to Y". Replaces sed / awk / perl -i / patch / tee / Edit / Write / shell redirects (`>`, `>>`) with hash-anchored tilth MCP edits for one-off block changes; sanctions `sg --rewrite` (ast-grep) for structural codemods that span many files. Always read first via cheez-read to get hash anchors for anchored edits. Prefer surgical anchored edits over whole-file rewrites. If tilth MCP is unavailable, stop and report rather than fall back. Do NOT use for reading files (cheez-read first to get anchors), searching code (use cheez-search), or running tests/builds.

# cheez-write

> **Hard dependency**: If `mcp__tilth__tilth_edit` is unavailable, stop immediately and report
> "tilth MCP server is not loaded — cannot proceed." Do NOT fall back to `Edit`, `Write`,
> or any host tool. Install via `tilth install <host> --edit` — the `--edit` flag is required
> to expose `tilth_edit` (see README "Installing tilth MCP").

## Capability detection

Before the first call, verify tilth's edit tool is reachable:

1. Check that `mcp__tilth__tilth_edit` is in your tool list. If only `tilth_read` and `tilth_search` are present, tilth was installed without `--edit`. Stop and report `"tilth MCP server is loaded but edit mode is disabled — re-install with 'tilth install <host> --edit'."`
2. The first edit call is a probe by definition — if it returns a JSON-RPC transport error (not a hash mismatch), stop and report `"tilth MCP server present but unhealthy: <error>"`.
3. Hash mismatches, syntax errors in the new content, or anchor-not-found are **content** issues — recover via the protocol below, do not bail.

Hash-anchored file editing via **tilth MCP** (`tilth_edit`).
Use hash anchors from tilth_read to make precise, surgical edits. Avoid
rewriting whole files unless the size and change ratio justify it (see
"When full-file rewrite is acceptable" below).

---

## Examples

### "Replace the body of `handleAuth` in `src/auth.ts`"

Step 1 — read with edit mode to get anchors:

```
tilth_read(path: "src/auth.ts", section: "44-89", edit: true)
# returns 44:b2c|... and 89:e1d|...
```

Step 2 — apply with the captured anchors:

```json
tilth_edit({
  "path": "src/auth.ts",
  "edits": [{
    "start": "44:b2c",
    "end":   "89:e1d",
    "content": "export function handleAuth(req, res, next) {\n  const token = extractToken(req);\n  if (!validateToken(token)) return res.status(401).end();\n  next();\n}"
  }]
})
```

Response confirms `Edit applied to src/auth.ts` and may list callers to
review.

### "Add an import without nuking the existing one on line 13"

`tilth_edit` replaces — there is no native insert. Anchor on line 13 and put
the original line back at the top of `content`:

```json
tilth_edit({
  "path": "src/auth.ts",
  "edits": [{
    "start": "13:abc",
    "content": "import { existingThing } from './existing';\nimport { newHelper } from './helpers';"
  }]
})
```

### "Hash mismatch — file changed under me"

```
Error: Hash mismatch at line 44
Expected: b2c
Found: f9a
```

Re-read the section, capture the new anchors, retry once. If it mismatches
again, **stop** — see "Hash Mismatch Handling → Repeated mismatches" below
(`tilth_edit` has no fuzzy / search-replace mode, so blind retries lose
races, not win them).

---

## Core Principle: Anchors, Not Rewrites

Traditional AI editing rewrites entire files, wasting tokens and risking data loss.
tilth_edit uses **hash anchors** — unique identifiers for each line — to:
- Make precise, surgical changes
- Reject edits if the file changed (hash mismatch)
- Show you exactly what changed

**The protocol:**
1. Read the file section with `tilth_read` (cheez-read) → get hash anchors
2. Note start/end anchors for the block you'll change
3. Call `tilth_edit` with those anchors and new content

---

## Hash Anchor Format

When you read a file with tilth_read in edit mode, lines have anchors:

```
42:a3f|  let x = compute();
43:f1b|  return x;
```

Format: `<line>:<hash>|<content>` (ASCII pipe, no space).

The hash is a short content fingerprint. If someone else edits the file,
hashes change, and your edit is safely rejected.

---

## MCP Tool Reference

### tilth_edit — Precise File Editing

The minimal shape — single anchor, replacement content:

```json
tilth_edit({
  "path": "src/auth.ts",
  "edits": [
    { "start": "42:a3f", "content": "  let x = recompute();" }
  ]
})
```

For range replacement, deletion, multi-edit, insert-after, cross-file
batches, and the `diff: true` response option, see
[`references/edit-patterns.md`](references/edit-patterns.md). That file is the
JSON cookbook; this body sticks to the protocol.

---

## The Read-Edit Protocol

### Step 1: Read to Get Anchors

```
tilth_read(path: "src/auth.ts", section: "44-89")
```

Output:
```
44:b2c|export function handleAuth(req, res, next) {
45:c3d|  const token = req.headers.authorization?.split(' ')[1];
...
88:d4e|  next();
89:e1d|}
```

### Step 2: Note Your Anchors

- **Start anchor:** `44:b2c` (first line of function)
- **End anchor:** `89:e1d` (closing brace)

### Step 3: Edit with Anchors

```json
tilth_edit({
  "path": "src/auth.ts",
  "edits": [{
    "start": "44:b2c",
    "end": "89:e1d",
    "content": "export function handleAuth(req, res, next) {\n  const token = extractToken(req);\n  if (!validateToken(token)) {\n    return res.status(401).json({ error: 'Invalid token' });\n  }\n  req.user = decodeToken(token);\n  next();\n}"
  }]
})
```

## Replacing Entire Functions

This is the most common use case. The pattern:

1. **Read the function** (outline first if file is large):
   ```
   tilth_read(path: "src/auth.ts")
   # See: [44-89]  export fn handleAuth(req, res, next)

   tilth_read(path: "src/auth.ts", section: "44-89")
   # Get hash anchors
   ```

2. **Note start/end anchors** from the hashlined output.

3. **Replace the entire function body:**
   ```json
   tilth_edit({
     "path": "src/auth.ts",
     "edits": [{
       "start": "44:b2c",
       "end": "89:e1d",
       "content": "<your new function implementation>"
     }]
   })
   ```

---

## Hash Mismatch Handling

If the file changed since you read it:

```
Error: Hash mismatch at line 44
Expected: b2c
Found: f9a

Current content:
44:f9a|export async function handleAuth(req, res, next) {
...
```

**Recovery:**
1. Read the section again → get new anchors.
2. Review the current content (someone else may have made changes).
3. Edit with new anchors.

This is a **safety feature**, not a bug.

### Repeated mismatches → bail out, don't loop

If you hit **two consecutive mismatches** on the same anchor, you're racing a
concurrent writer. `tilth_edit` has no fuzzy / search-replace mode — there
is no "ignore the hash, just match this string" option. A third retry will
likely lose the same race.

The correct move is to bail and report:

1. Read the latest section one final time and capture the current content.
2. Prepare the new content as a unified diff or full block, but **do not
   apply** it.
3. Report `"hash-anchor race on <path>:<line>; current content and proposed
   replacement attached. Retry once the file is quiescent or apply manually."`
   along with the captured anchors and proposed content.
4. Stop. Let the orchestrator (or a human) decide whether to apply the change
   or escalate.

This trades automation for safety — losing a race twice means whatever's
writing the file is faster than your read-edit cycle, and a third blind
retry could overwrite real work.

---

## Caller Updates After Signature Changes

When you edit a function signature, tilth_edit shows callers that may need updating:

```
Edit applied to src/auth.ts

── callers that may need updates ──
  src/routes/api.ts:34   router.use('/api/*', handleAuth)
  src/routes/admin.ts:12 app.use(handleAuth)
  src/middleware.ts:8    const wrapped = handleAuth(...)
```

Check these locations and update if needed.

## Common Patterns

| Goal | Pattern | Reference |
|------|---------|-----------|
| Replace one line | single anchor, new `content` | [edit-patterns.md#single-line-replacement](references/edit-patterns.md#single-line-replacement) |
| Replace a range | `start` + `end` anchors | [edit-patterns.md#multi-line-range-replacement](references/edit-patterns.md#multi-line-range-replacement) |
| Delete a block | range with `content: ""` | [edit-patterns.md#delete-a-block](references/edit-patterns.md#delete-a-block) |
| Insert after a line | anchor on that line, prepend its content | [edit-patterns.md#insert-after-a-line](references/edit-patterns.md#insert-after-a-line) |
| Multi-edit in one file | `edits: [...]` ordered bottom-up | [edit-patterns.md#multiple-edits-in-one-call](references/edit-patterns.md#multiple-edits-in-one-call) |
| Cross-file change | one `tilth_edit` call per file | [edit-patterns.md#edits-across-multiple-files](references/edit-patterns.md#edits-across-multiple-files) |

---

## Large Files: Outline First

For large files, tilth_read shows an outline, not hashlined content:

```
# src/giant.ts (2400 lines, ~32k tokens) [outline]

[1-20]    imports
[22-89]   interface Config
[91-450]  class GiantHandler
  [100-180]  fn process
  [182-340]  fn validate
```

**To edit, drill into the specific section:**

```
tilth_read(path: "src/giant.ts", section: "100-180")
# Now you get hashlined content for fn process
```

Then edit with those anchors.

---

## When full-file rewrite is acceptable

Hash-anchored, surgical edits are the default. There is one exception:

| File size | Policy |
|-----------|--------|
| **> 150 lines** | Never rewrite the whole file. Always hash-anchored. |
| **≤ 150 lines** | Anchored single-edit preferred, but a full rewrite (delete-everything + insert) is acceptable when **≥ 80%** of the file is changing. Below that threshold, do the surgical edit. |

The 150-line / 80% threshold is informed by 2026 industry data (Cursor's
published numbers, can.ac analysis, the Morph benchmark) showing full-file
rewrites tie or beat diff-style on small files. The threshold keeps the
spirit conservative — large files always stay anchored.

When you do rewrite a small file in full, still use `tilth_edit` (anchor on
line 1, end-anchor on the last line). Do **not** drop to host `Write` —
that bypasses tilth's hash-mismatch safety.

---

## Structural codemods — `sg --rewrite` escape

`tilth_edit` excels at "replace this specific block in this specific file"
with hash-anchor concurrency safety. It handles cross-cutting structural
changes awkwardly: one file at a time, one read-for-anchors per location.
For codemods — "rewrite every `JSON.parse(JSON.stringify($X))` to
`structuredClone($X)`", "convert every `var $X = $Y` to `let $X = $Y`" —
drop to `sg --rewrite` (ast-grep) via Bash. This is the **only** sanctioned
shell escape from cheez-write.

The two tools are **complementary, not redundant**:

| Tool | Safety property | Best for |
|------|------------------|----------|
| `tilth_edit` | Hash-anchor (concurrency) | Specific-block edits, signature changes |
| `sg --rewrite` | Structural match (CST) | Cross-cutting codemods over N files |

When the change repeats across many locations and the surrounding text
varies, `sg --rewrite` captures the variable parts via metavars and templates
them back into the rewrite — `tilth_edit` cannot express that without N
reads.

For invocation rules (`--lang`, `--json`, no `--interactive`), pitfalls
(CST-not-AST, metavar binding, lenient-by-default), and the **non-negotiable
dry-run-first protocol** (search → clean tree → `-U` → diff → revert if too
loose), see
[`../cheez-search/references/sg-patterns.md`](../cheez-search/references/sg-patterns.md)
— the "Structural codemods (`sg --rewrite`)" and "Pitfalls" sections in
particular.

`sg --rewrite` does not have hash-anchor safety. Treat each codemod as a
single transactional change between two clean git states; never layer
additional edits on top until the codemod is committed or reverted.

---

## DO NOT

- **DO NOT rewrite files > 150 lines** — use hash anchors for surgical edits.
- **DO NOT rewrite small files when the change is < 80%** — anchor the changed range only.
- **DO NOT guess hash values** — always read first to get current anchors.
- **DO NOT ignore hash mismatches** — re-read and retry (see Hash Mismatch Handling).
- **DO NOT use sed / awk / perl -i** to edit code — they bypass hash anchors and structural safety, and have no mismatch detection. `sg --rewrite` is the *only* sanctioned shell escape, and only for structural codemods that follow the dry-run-first protocol.
- **DO NOT use `patch`** to apply diffs to code — `tilth_edit`'s anchored ranges are the safe equivalent.
- **DO NOT use `tee` or shell redirects (`>`, `>>`)** to overwrite/append code files — both bypass anchors. Use `tilth_edit`.
- **DO NOT use the host Edit/Write tool** — use `tilth_edit` (or `sg --rewrite` for structural codemods) exclusively for code.
- **DO NOT use `sg --rewrite` for one-off block edits** — that's `tilth_edit` territory. The codemod escape is only for cross-cutting structural changes; using it on a single location wastes its strength and skips hash-anchor safety.
- **DO NOT skip the dry-run-first protocol for `sg --rewrite`** — search-only first, clean working tree, then `-U`. Never combine search+rewrite blindly.
- **DO NOT edit without reading** — you need the anchors.
- **DO NOT use for reading** — use cheez-read.
- **DO NOT use for searching** — use cheez-search.

---

## What This Skill Doesn't Do

- **Read files** — use cheez-read first to get anchors.
- **Search code** — use cheez-search to find what to edit.
- **Run tests after editing** — use test/build skills.
- **Commit changes** — use git/gh skills.
- **Review your edits** — use age/code-review skills.
