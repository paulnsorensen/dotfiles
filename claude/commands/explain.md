Let's make sure you understand: $ARGUMENTS

## My Approach:
1. Explain the concept (no code first)
2. Draw a diagram if helpful
3. Ask YOU to predict behavior
4. Then show code with your predictions in mind

## Before I explain:
What do you already know about this? (Even a guess helps me calibrate.)
