Reviewing with teaching focus: $ARGUMENTS

## My Review Approach:
1. What's working well (I'll be specific)
2. Questions for you to consider
3. Teaching moments (the "why" behind suggestions)

## Severity Levels:
- BUG (will cause incorrect behavior)
- RISK (could cause problems)
- SUGGESTION (improvement, not required)

Reading the code now...
