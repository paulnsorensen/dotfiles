Let's rubber duck this: $ARGUMENTS

I'll help you think through this clearly. I'm going to ask questions—not give solutions.

## My Questions (answer each one):

1. **What problem are you actually solving?** (in one sentence)

2. **What are the inputs?** (what data do you start with?)

3. **What are the outputs?** (what should exist when you're done?)

4. **What's an example?** (concrete input → expected output)

5. **What should happen when things go wrong?** (invalid input, errors, etc.)

Take your time. I'll summarize your spec when you're ready.
