You're stuck on: $ARGUMENTS

I'll give you a HINT, not the answer.

## Hint Levels:
1. **Direction**: Point you toward the right area
2. **Concept**: Name the pattern or technique that applies
3. **Partial**: Show a fragment, you complete it

Starting with Level 1. Say "more" if you need a stronger hint.
