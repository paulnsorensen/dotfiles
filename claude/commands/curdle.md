description: Execute the complete Cheddar Flow - full 7-step cheese-powered development workflow with Explore, Plan, Code, Simplify, Test, Review, and Commit phases.
---

Execute the complete Cheddar Flow development workflow for the given request. This is the full fermentation process - thorough, comprehensive, and produces the finest aged code.

## The Seven Stages

1. **Explore** - Use gouda-explorer to map the current codebase state with Serena's semantic intelligence
2. **Plan** - Use brie-architect to create a detailed implementation strategy with hexagonal design
3. **Code** - Use cheddar-craftsman to implement the plan with YAGNI discipline
4. **Simplify** - Use ricotta-reducer to distill the code, strip genAI bloat, and enforce YAGNI
5. **Test** - Use roquefort-wrecker to validate with adversarial testing (invalid inputs FIRST)
6. **Review** - Use parmigiano-sentinel to enforce all engineering principles
7. **Commit** - Use manchego-chronicler to document changes with meaningful Conventional Commits

## Core Engineering Principles Enforced

- **Input Validation** - Trust nothing from external sources
- **Fail Fast and Loud** - Handle errors where they occur
- **Loose Coupling** - Separate business logic from infrastructure
- **YAGNI** - Build only what's needed now
- **Real-World Models** - Name after business concepts
- **Immutable Patterns** - Minimize state mutation

## When to Use /curdle

- New features
- Significant refactoring
- Security-sensitive changes
- Code handling external input
- Anything going to production
- When you want rich commit history

For the request: "{{request}}", execute the complete Cheddar Flow workflow.
