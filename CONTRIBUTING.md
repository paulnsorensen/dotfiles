# Contributing to dotfiles

Thanks for your interest. Contributions of all sizes are welcome — a
typo fix is just as useful as a feature. This document describes how
to get from "I want to help" to "my change is merged".

## Filing issues

- Search [open issues](https://github.com/paulnsorensen/dotfiles/issues)
  before opening a new one.
- Use the bug-report or feature-request template.
- For security vulnerabilities, do **not** open a public issue — see
  [`SECURITY.md`](./SECURITY.md).

## Setting up locally

```sh
git clone https://github.com/paulnsorensen/dotfiles.git
cd dotfiles
dots sync   # render registries + apply chezmoi
```

See [`AGENTS.md`](./AGENTS.md) for the repo layout and source-of-truth
rules — never edit a rendered target; edit the source and re-run
`dots sync`.

## Running tests

```sh
just check   # full gate: shell lint + Bats + renderer tests
dots test    # Bats suites only
```

Please run the full test suite before opening a PR.

## Submitting a pull request

1. Fork the repo and create a topic branch from `main`.
2. Make your change. Keep commits focused; one concern per commit is
   easier to review than a kitchen-sink commit.
3. Use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org)
   for the PR title (e.g. `feat: add X`, `fix: handle Y`,
   `docs: explain Z`). Squash-merge will use the PR title as the
   commit subject.
4. Fill out the PR template — the "why" matters more than the "what".
5. Wait for CI to go green and address review feedback.
