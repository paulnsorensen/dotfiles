# The Validate Cycle

Any mode can invoke a Validate Cycle. Always **announce the cycle** before dispatching — the announcement is part of the discipline.

## The frame

```text
Launching a validate cycle on hypothesis: "<single declarative sentence>"

Plan:
  /briesearch  — fetch evidence
  Judge        — support, contradict, or refine?
  Settle       — accept, revise, or reject. Continue from current mode.
```

A bare `/briesearch` call without this frame is discouraged. The frame forces commitment to a hypothesis plus a judgment step.

## Outcomes

| Outcome | Meaning | Next action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **SUPPORTED** | Evidence aligns with the hypothesis | Promote to a decision |
| **CONTRADICTED** | Evidence disagrees | Mark `[CONFLICT <id>]`, revise or abandon |
| **REFINED** | Evidence partially aligns | Restate with new precision and re-validate or accept |

Diagnose's parallel hypothesis ranking IS this cycle, parallelized.

## Budget

Validate cycles are **context-bounded, not capped** (ADR-003 of the mold-parity
spec). Confidence-gathering is the goal; an arbitrary cap cuts it short.

- **No hard cap.** Run as many `/briesearch` cycles as confidence needs. The
  context-budget mechanic (`context-budget.md`) is the natural limiter — offload
  deep evidence to a sub-agent and watch the window.
- **Soft backstop of 10.** At the 10th launched cycle, ask once "still gathering —
  continue?"; it is a check, not a stop, and the user can wave it through.
- Cycles backed by local semantic source-code evidence alone are unbudgeted — they do not count toward the backstop.

The same context-bounded rule governs Prototype Cycles (`prototype-cycle.md`).

## When to skip

- The claim is already grounded by a bounded source read or earlier cycle; source-code reads follow the [shared routing contract](../../cheese/references/code-intelligence-routing.md).
- The decision is reversible and small — running a cycle costs more than just trying it.
- The user explicitly said "skip the cycle".

## Logging

Every launched cycle is logged in the mold state file:

```yaml
validate_cycles:
  - id: vc-1
    hypothesis: "Express's Router supports per-route middleware arrays"
    outcome: SUPPORTED
    sources: [Context7]
  - id: vc-2
    hypothesis: "We can hot-swap the auth middleware without restart"
    outcome: CONTRADICTED
    conflict_id: cf-1
```

Open hypotheses (no `outcome:`) block Curdle until they settle or are explicitly accepted as `[TBD]`.
