# Ask user question

Use this reference whenever a skill needs user input. It owns question transport;
workflow-specific records and consequences stay with the calling skill.

## Semantic question record

Build the decision before choosing a host tool:

```yaml
question:
  id: stable-id
  prompt: One short decision
  recommended: option-id
  multi: false
  options:
    - id: option-id
      label: Short label
      description: Effect or tradeoff
```

The record is the source of truth. A host rendering may change presentation, but it must preserve the prompt, recommended choice, every option's effect or tradeoff, selection mode, and a free-form `Other` path.

**Self-containment (hard).** The rendered question must stand alone: a user seeing only the widget — a truncated `prompt` plus short option `label`/`description` fields — must be able to understand the decision and every option's tradeoff without hunting for prose elsewhere. Host widgets truncate the `prompt` and hide any assistant text that is not in the same visible turn (or that lives in a thinking block). So never rely on framing that sits in a separate message, an earlier turn, or a thinking block: either fold the needed context into the `prompt` and each option's `description`, or emit a visible prose block in the same turn immediately before the question call. A picker that arrives with no visible framing is a transport defect, not a rendering quirk.

## When to structure

Answers *when* a decision may be a structured question; capability-first
rendering (above) governs *how* once that gate passes.

**Freshness rule.** A structured question may only confirm a trade-off
already discussed with the user this session. A structured question must
never introduce an undiscussed design option — anything undiscussed gets
prose weighing first, before any structured question.

**Mechanical fast-path.** A mechanical item is intelligible without
prior-session context — for example, a branch name or a yes/no dispatch. A
mechanical item may be asked as a direct structured question.

**Design definition.** A design item is one whose options need session
context to be intelligible — the tradeoffs cannot be judged without the
discussion behind them. An undiscussed design fork is by definition
non-fresh.

**One confirm, never bundled.** After prose convergence, ask at most one
structured confirm. Never bundle multiple design forks into one prompt.

## Capability-first rendering

One rule: use the richest callable structured question primitive visible in
your active tool list that can faithfully encode the complete decision;
otherwise use the portable fallback below. The active tool list is the runtime
authority for what exists and what it can hold — read the active primitive's
advertised question and option capacities from its schema instead of assuming a
harness-wide limit, and never consult a harness lookup table to learn a tool's
name. Never name a host tool in the transcript unless it is callable in that
session.

Wrapper and orchestrator hosts such as Conductor and Emdash / Em Dash route to
the selected underlying agent or provider rather than inventing a common
question schema. Runtime capability detection always wins over the wrapper or provider name. If the expected provider primitive is absent, denied, headless,
or too small for the complete decision, use the lossless fallback.

Caveats that capability detection alone cannot infer:

- **Capacity-limited schemas.** If an active schema advertises only 2-3
  explicit choices, a four-option decision does not fit: render every option
  with the numbered fallback, or use a lossless hybrid where every omitted
  button remains an explicit numbered choice. Never merge or drop options to
  make the tool call fit.
- **Mode-gated tools.** Use a question tool only when the active tool list and
  current collaboration mode both allow it (Codex `request_user_input` is the
  known case).
- **Headless modes.** JSON/print or another non-interactive mode must use
  numbered text even when a question tool is nominally loaded.
- **Auto-select timeouts.** Do not use a timeout that can auto-select a
  blocking approval or state-changing choice (OMP `ask` exposes one).
- **MCP elicitation.** `elicitation/create` is only for an MCP server
  requesting user input through a client that supports elicitation; it is not
  a general assistant-to-user question primitive.

This is native-first, not lowest-common-denominator behavior. Never merge, hide, or drop options to fit a host primitive.

Per-harness tool names and doc citations are maintainer evidence, not runtime
instructions — they live in
[`ask-user-question-sources.md`](ask-user-question-sources.md). Do not read
that appendix to answer a question; the active tool list already shows what is
callable.

## Portable fallback

```markdown
Question: <one short question>
Recommended: <label> — <recommended option's description>

1. <label> — <effect/tradeoff>
2. <label> — <effect/tradeoff>
3. <label> — <effect/tradeoff>
4. <label> — <effect/tradeoff, when present>
... <continue until every question option is explicit>
Other: reply with `other: <short answer>`
```

A fallback must enumerate every option; its list is not capped at three. When
`question.recommended` names an option, render its label and description on the
`Recommended:` line; do not assume it is option 1. When
`question.recommended` is `none`, omit the `Recommended:` line.
A hybrid is lossless only when every action omitted from the structured control
remains an explicit, equally actionable numbered choice.

## Batching and defaults

- Ask one decision by default.
- Batch at most three related questions, and only when the callable primitive
  explicitly supports batching.
- Mark the recommended option; never select it merely because it is recommended.
- Never auto-resolve a blocking approval or state-changing choice.
- Use single-select unless the semantic record explicitly sets `multi: true`.

## Normalize the answer

1. Map a displayed 1-based ordinal to the corresponding option `id`. Otherwise,
   normalize an option `id`, an unambiguous option label, or a free-form
   `other:` value.
2. Preserve multiple selections only when `multi: true`.
3. If the answer is ambiguous, ask one clarifying question through this same
   transport; do not guess.
4. Return the normalized value to the calling skill. The caller owns what
   happens after selection.
