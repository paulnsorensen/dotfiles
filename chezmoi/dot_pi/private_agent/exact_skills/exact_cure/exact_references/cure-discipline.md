# /cure — Fix-Application Discipline

## Iron Law

**No finding is "fixed" without a gate-passing test run to prove it.**

Applying an edit is not the same as curing a finding. Every applied fix runs
the narrowest test that proves the fix, then any relevant project-wide gates,
before the finding moves to `### Applied`. A fix whose tests were not run is
not applied — it is staged.

## Red Flags

Stop if you notice yourself thinking any of these:

- "The fix is obviously correct; running tests is formality."
- "I'll run the full suite at the end rather than after each fix."
- "The finding description is clear enough; I don't need to re-read the
  cited code before applying."
- "The age report is wrong about this finding; I'll apply the fix anyway and
  note it."
- "All findings came from one logical problem; I can fix them in one edit
  without validating each."
- Declaring a finding `### Applied` while any gate is still red.

Each of these is a rationalization. Name it and stop.

## Rationalization table

| Rationalization | Why it fails | Required action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| "The fix is obviously correct; tests are formality." | "Obvious" fixes introduce subtle regressions at a higher rate than non-obvious ones, because they skip the mental check that a test encodes. | Run the narrowest test that proves the fix before marking Applied. |
| "I'll validate all fixes together at the end." | A later test failure cannot be attributed to a specific fix without re-running individual ones. Batched validation hides which fix broke what. | Validate each fix individually, in order. |
| "The finding rests on a false premise; I'll skip it." | Silently skipping a finding is not the same as disagreeing with it. If the age claim is wrong, say so in the report. | Put the finding in Deferred with the rebuttal. Do not silently drop it. |
| "I don't need to re-read the code; the finding location is clear." | Fix locations shift during a cure pass. A stale read produces an edit at the wrong anchor. | Re-read the cited location through a fresh bounded read before every edit; follow the [shared routing contract](../../cheese/references/code-intelligence-routing.md). |
| "All findings stem from one root cause; one edit covers all." | This may be true, but it must be verified. Apply the edit, run the gate, then re-check which remaining findings the gate result clears. | Apply once, validate, then re-read each remaining finding to confirm it is resolved. |
| "The gate is flaky; I'll mark the fix Applied and note the flakiness." | A flaky gate is a blocker, not an excuse. Marking Applied on a red gate means the cure report lies. | Record the flakiness in Checks. Do not mark Applied. Surface the blocker. |
| "This finding is low severity; I can skip validation to save time." | Low-severity fixes fail tests at the same rate as high-severity ones. Severity is about impact, not about validation cost. | Validate every applied fix regardless of severity. |
