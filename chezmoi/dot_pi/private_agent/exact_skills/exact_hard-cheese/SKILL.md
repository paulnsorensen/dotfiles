description: Metacognitive vibecheck gate before code is shared for review — make the author explain the diff's causal logic, graded by a fresh-context judge against the SOLO Taxonomy. Use when the user wants this gate — phrases like "/hard-cheese", "/cheese --hard", "gate this before I push", "vibecheck me", "make sure I understand this diff", "epistemic-debt check". Use standalone before opening a PR, or as the `--hard` flag propagated through the pipeline. Do NOT use for code review (`/age`), test hardening (`/press`), or fix application (`/cure`).

# /hard-cheese

The gate mitigates **epistemic debt** — the failure mode where AI-scaffolded code passes review, type-checks, and tests green while the author cannot explain it to a reviewer.

## Inputs

```text
/hard-cheese [<slug>] [--socratic-cap N=3] [--passing-score N=3] [--no-judge]
```

Arguments:

- `<slug>` — optional. Identifies the artifact at `.cheese/hard-cheese/<slug>.md`. When omitted, fall back to the git short SHA of `HEAD`. An explicit slug always wins.
- `--socratic-cap N` — max retry attempts before the gate marks the artifact `FAILED` and exits non-zero. Default `3`. Vibecheck does not cap; easy-cheese does to avoid infinite loops.
- `--passing-score N` — minimum SOLO score that counts as PASS. Valid range `1..5`; default `3` (Multistructural-or-higher). A previous PASS below the requested threshold is treated as stale and must be re-judged.
- `--no-judge` — log-only mode. Capture the user's explanation, write the artifact with `status: LOGGED`, skip the judge sub-agent spawn. Mirrors vibecheck's optional JSONL telemetry mode.

## Invocation modes

| Mode | How it fires | Where the gate sits |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **standalone** | User runs `/hard-cheese <slug>` directly before opening a pull request. | Outside the pipeline. No upstream skill required. |
| **propagated** | `/plate --hard` invokes `/hard-cheese <slug>` after its final writing gate and before publication. | At the verified-artifacts → share-for-review boundary. |

`--hard` propagates through `/cheese → /mold → /cook → /press → /age → /cure → /plate`. Upstream skills pass the flag; `/plate` is the only pipeline skill that invokes `/hard-cheese`.

Portability reference: [`../cheese/references/harness-portability.md`](../cheese/references/harness-portability.md). It covers helper resolution, sub-agent dispatch, GitHub operations, and handoff transitions; prefer the bundled or repo-local helper first, and treat `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}` as optional host-provided fallback.
The handoff blocks below are the portable contract; slash commands are host renderings, not the control model.

## Flow

1. **Resolve scope.**
   - `diff_base = origin/main`, `diff_head = <short-sha of HEAD>`.
   - If `.cheese/specs/<slug>.md` exists, load it as the intent reference (optional — diff is the ground truth).
   - Slug fallback when none supplied: the HEAD short SHA.
   - If the working tree has no diff against `origin/main`, exit `0` with `"nothing to gate on"` and write no artifact.

2. **Freshness check.**
   Check freshness before launching the gate:

   ```
   python3 skills/hard-cheese/scripts/hard-cheese.pyz freshness-check \
     --slug <slug> --passing-score <n>
   ```

   Exit 0 (`previously_passed`): print `"previously passed"` and exit `0`. Exit 2 (`stale`: HEAD moved or the last PASS score is below `--passing-score`) or 3 (`new`): continue to step 3.

3. **Compose the vibecheck prompt** (faithful to Sankaranarayanan 2026, generalised to "share for review" so the gate stays implementation-agnostic):

   > Before this is shared for review, explain its causal logic in your own words. How does *<feature or fix>* work? Why does it produce the desired behavior? What state, control flow, or invariants does it rely on?

   Render a diff summary alongside the prompt. When invoked by `/plate`, also render `/plate`'s final artifact inventory and `{target, backend, verified}` rows so the explanation covers the exact state about to be shared.

4. **Capture the user's explanation** as free text. No coaching, no example answers — the explanation is the artifact under test.

5. **Spawn the judge sub-agent** in fresh context (same pattern `/cook`'s fan pathway uses for adversarial review). The judge:
   - Reads `references/judge-prompt.md` as its system prompt.
   - Receives the passing score threshold, the diff summary, the spec excerpt (if any), and the user's explanation as context.
   - Returns a JSON object: `{score, level, pass, feedback, socratic_qs}`.

   See `references/judge-prompt.md` for the full system prompt and output shape.

   Skip this step when `--no-judge` is set: mark the attempt `status: LOGGED`, write the artifact, exit `0`.

6. **On judge result:**
   - `score >= <passing-score>` → PASS. `score < <passing-score>` → FAIL, render Socratic questions, loop to step 4 if `attempts < --socratic-cap`. Judge error → ERROR attempt, print warning, exit `0` (fail-open — see `## Divergence from the paper`).

   Append the attempt row:

   ```
   python3 skills/hard-cheese/scripts/hard-cheese.pyz append-attempt \
     --slug <slug> --status <PASS|FAIL|ERROR> --score <n> \
     --feedback "<judge feedback>" --explanation "<user explanation>"
   ```

7. **On cap exhaustion:** set the artifact `status: FAILED`, print the path, exit non-zero. Downstream chains must not proceed.

## Artifact

`.cheese/hard-cheese/<slug>.md` is the audit trail. The directory is gitignored by repo convention (`.gitignore` already ignores `.cheese/`), so the trail stays local — matching vibecheck's local-only stance on telemetry.

Each file opens with a YAML frontmatter block that travels with the audit trail:

```yaml
---
slug: <slug>
attribution: Sankaranarayanan 2026 / vibecheck
rubric: SOLO Taxonomy (1-5), pass threshold = <passing-score>
passing_score: <n>
divergence: fail-open on judge error (vibecheck fails closed)
diff_base: <sha>
diff_head: <short-sha>
status: PASS | FAIL | FAILED | LOGGED
attempts: <n>
---
```

The attempt log uses a 6-column markdown table (written by `append-attempt`):

```markdown
| timestamp | head_sha | status | score | feedback | explanation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2026-06-25T10:00:00+00:00 | a1b2c3d | FAIL | 2 | "Unistructural: lists steps but no causal link" | <user explanation verbatim> |
| 2026-06-25T10:05:00+00:00 | a1b2c3d | PASS | 4 | "Relational: explains why invariant holds" | <user explanation verbatim> |
```

Attempts append; nothing is overwritten within a single invocation. If a re-invocation finds the artifact stale (HEAD moved), new attempt rows are appended below the prior ones — the trail is cumulative.

## Sub-agent contract — fresh judge

- **Fresh context, every invocation.** Same-context judging is biased toward the code it helped write.
- Resolve a no-tool or read-only `reviewer` through the shared agent resolver at `default` power and `high` effort. A general worker qualifies only with prompt-only no-write enforcement and `degraded: true`.
- `references/judge-prompt.md` is the system prompt. The judge reads the supplied diff summary, spec excerpt, and explanation, then returns JSON without repository writes.
- **JSON output is parsed.** If parsing fails, the attempt is logged as `ERROR` and the gate fails open (see `## Divergence from the paper`).

If the host harness has no sub-agent primitive, `/hard-cheese` is the wrong skill — the gate cannot run without a fresh judge. Recommend `/hard-cheese --no-judge` for users who still want the explanation captured as telemetry without the grading step.

The attribution appears in this `SKILL.md`, in `references/judge-prompt.md`, and in every `.cheese/hard-cheese/<slug>.md` artifact so the citation travels with the audit trail.

## Divergence from the paper

Hard-cheese departs from vibecheck in exactly one place, and the divergence is called out explicitly so it stays legible:

**Vibecheck fails closed on judge error.** If the Judge LLM cannot produce a verdict, the modal blocks code application until the judge recovers or the user retries with a different model.

**Hard-cheese fails open on judge error.** If the fresh-context judge sub-agent crashes, times out, or returns malformed JSON, the gate writes an `ERROR` attempt, prints a clear warning, and exits `0` — the user is allowed to proceed.

Rationale: judge invocation is per-PR-attempt and per-retry, and a strict fail-closed policy creates a worse experience under API hiccups than the epistemic-debt cost it averts. New divergences must be added here.

## Composition with `--auto`

`--hard` and `--auto` may coexist. The gate punctures auto exactly once inside terminal `/plate --hard`, after `/plate` verifies final artifacts and before publication. The user responds, then PASS permits publication, FAILED halts, and ERROR follows the documented fail-open behavior.

Commit-only `/plate --hard` does not fire because nothing is shared. For a new PR under auto, `/plate` honors explicit topology, infers an obviously cohesive single, and asks when stacked is recommended or shape is ambiguous. Non-TTY behavior lives in `references/composition.md`.

## Output

When the gate ends, print:

```
Hard-cheese artifact: .cheese/hard-cheese/<slug>.md
Status: PASS | FAILED | LOGGED | ERROR
Score: <n>/5 (<SOLO level>, pass ≥ <passing-score>)
Attempts: <n>
```

The `Score` line reports the latest judged attempt. Omit it when no attempt was judged — LOGGED mode, or an ERROR run with no scored attempts.

Followed by:

- On PASS: `Ready to share for review.`
- On FAILED: `Cap exhausted. Improve understanding of the change before sharing.`
- On LOGGED: `Telemetry only — judge skipped via --no-judge.`
- On ERROR: a one-line warning naming the failure mode and `Fail-open divergence active — gate exited 0; you may share for review at your discretion.`

## Preferred tools and fallbacks

| Need | Prefer | Fallback |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Diff inspection for the user-facing summary | `delta` | `git diff --unified=3` |
| Reading the spec (when present) | bounded file read per [`code-intelligence-routing.md`](../cheese/references/code-intelligence-routing.md) | host file read |
| Spawning the judge | host sub-agent primitive (`Agent()` or harness equivalent) | none — without sub-agent spawn, run `--no-judge` mode and tell the user the judge is unavailable |
| GitHub / PR context (out of scope here) | n/a | n/a |

## Rules

- The judge sub-agent runs in fresh context. Do not let the same conversation that wrote the code grade the human's understanding of it.
- Do not coach the user before they answer. The explanation is the artifact under test. Socratic questions appear only *after* a FAIL, and only the questions returned by the judge — no extra hints from the parent.
- Do not paraphrase the user's explanation before passing it to the judge. The judge grades what the user wrote, verbatim.
- Do not skip the freshness check. Re-invoking after HEAD has moved must trigger a fresh attempt sequence — prior comprehension is stale once the code changes.
- Do not silently drop ERROR attempts. The fail-open divergence requires that every judge failure is recorded in the artifact and surfaced to the user as a warning.
- Do not invoke `/gh` or any specific PR-creation tool. The gate's contract is "before code is shared for review" — implementation-agnostic.
- Apply the shared voice kernel (lives at `../age/references/voice.md`): say what the gate result was, flag residual risk as `certain | speculating | don't know`, do not soften FAILED into "almost passing".
